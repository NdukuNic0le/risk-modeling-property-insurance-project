# Property Risk Project

## Project Overview

### Executive Summary
This is a risk modeling project that analyzes and calculates the likelihood of weather-related damage to properties in Kenya. Rather than predicting specific events, we're assessing risk levels based on various factors.

### Data Infrastructure
A robust data collection and processing pipeline that tracks:
- Property characteristics (value, type, age, location)
- Historical weather events
- Damage incidents and their financial impact
- Geographical risk factors

### Risk Assessment Framework

#### 1. Feature Engineering
The feature engineering processes considers:

**Property-Specific Metrics:**
- Building age and depreciation factors
- Property values and historical appreciations
- Distance to water bodies (flood risk indicator)
- Elevation data
- Construction type and quality indicators

**Event-Based Analytics:**
- Frequency of weather incidents
- Severity patterns
- Cumulative damage history
- Time between incidents
- Seasonal risk variations

**Location-Based Risk Factors:**
- Zone-specific risk profiles (Coastal, Urban, Rural)
- Historical weather patterns by region
- Proximity to high-risk areas

#### 2. Modeling
Implemented an ensemble approach using three machine learning models:
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

Each model was chosen for its specific strengths:
1. **Random Forest:** Excellent at handling non-linear relationships and categorical variables
2. **Gradient Boosting:** Strong performance with numerical features and complex patterns
3. **XGBoost:** Superior handling of large-scale data and efficient processing

### Why
Insurance companies need to make informed decisions about risk assessment and pricing.
By creating this risk assessment system, we:
- Calculate risk levels more accurately and consistently
- Understand the factors that contribute most to property damage
- Process risk assessments more efficiently
- Help property owners understand their risk exposure
- Enable more accurate pricing based on actual risk levels
- Better prepare for potential future claims based on risk profiles

### How
Three main steps:

#### 1. Collecting and Organizing Data
- Gather information about properties (like their age, location, and value)
- Compile historical weather event data
- Analyze past damage incidents and their costs
- Organize all this information to understand patterns and relationships

#### 2. Analyzing Patterns and Risk Factors
- Identify which characteristics are associated with higher or lower risk levels
- Examine how different factors combine to influence overall risk
- Analyze geographical patterns and seasonal variations in risk levels
- Quantify the relationship between property characteristics and damage occurrence

#### 3. Calculating Risk Likelihood
- Use three different statistical methods to calculate risk levels
- Compare our calculations against actual historical data to ensure accuracy
- Create clear risk assessment scores for insurance professionals
- Continuously refine our calculations as new data becomes available

### Next Steps

**Model Refinement:**
- Continue fine-tuning hyperparameters
- Implement cross-validation scoring metrics
- Develop ensemble weighting strategies

**Risk Scoring System:**
- Develop a standardized risk scoring system
- Create risk categories for underwriting guidelines
- Implement automated risk assessment tools

**Business Integration:**
- Create API endpoints for real-time risk assessment
- Develop user interfaces for underwriters
- Establish monitoring systems for model performance
