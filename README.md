# Project Overview <br/>
**Executive Summary**<br/>
This is a risk modeling project  that analyzes and calculates the likelihood of weather-related damage to properties in Kenya. Rather than predicting specific events, we're assessing risk levels based on various factors.<br/>
<br/>
**Data Infrastructure**<br/>
A robust data collection and processing pipeline that tracks:<br/>
<br/>
Property characteristics (value, type, age, location)<br/>
Historical weather events<br/>
Damage incidents and their financial impact<br/>
Geographical risk factors<br/>
<br/>
**Risk Assessment Framework**<br/>
**1. Feature Engineering**<br/>
The feature engineering processes considers:<br/>
Property-Specific Metrics:<br/>
<br/>
Building age and depreciation factors<br/>
Property values and historical appreciations<br/>
Distance to water bodies (flood risk indicator)<br/>
Elevation data<br/>
Construction type and quality indicators<br/>
<br/>
Event-Based Analytics:<br/>
<br/>
Frequency of weather incidents<br/>
Severity patterns<br/>
Cumulative damage history<br/>
Time between incidents<br/>
Seasonal risk variations<br/>
<br/>
Location-Based Risk Factors:<br/>
<br/>
Zone-specific risk profiles (Coastal, Urban, Rural)<br/>
Historical weather patterns by region<br/>
Proximity to high-risk areas<br/>
<br/>
**2. Modeling**<br/>
Implemented an ensemble approach using three machine learning models:<br/>
<br/>
Random Forest Regression<br/>
Gradient Boosting<br/>
XGBoost<br/>
<br/>
Each model was chosen for its specific strengths:<br/>
<br/>
1. Random Forest: Excellent at handling non-linear relationships and categorical variables<br/>
2. Gradient Boosting: Strong performance with numerical features and complex patterns<br/>
3. XGBoost: Superior handling of large-scale data and efficient processing<br/>
<br/>
**Why**<br/>
Insurance companies need to make informed decisions about risk assessment and pricing.<br/>
By creating this risk assessment system, we:<br/>
<br/>
Calculate risk levels more accurately and consistently<br/>
Understand the factors that contribute most to property damage<br/>
Process risk assessments more efficiently<br/>
Help property owners understand their risk exposure<br/>
Enable more accurate pricing based on actual risk levels<br/>
Better prepare for potential future claims based on risk profiles<br/>
<br/>
**How**<br/>
Three main steps:<br/>
<br/>
**1. Collecting and Organizing Data**<br/>
<br/>
Gather information about properties (like their age, location, and value)<br/>
Compile historical weather event data<br/>
Analyze past damage incidents and their costs<br/>
Organize all this information to understand patterns and relationships<br/>
<br/>
**2. Analyzing Patterns and Risk Factors**<br/>
<br/>
Identify which characteristics are associated with higher or lower risk levels<br/>
Examine how different factors combine to influence overall risk<br/>
Analyze geographical patterns and seasonal variations in risk levels<br/>
Quantify the relationship between property characteristics and damage occurrence<br/>
<br/>
**3. Calculating Risk Likelihood**<br/>
<br/>
Use three different statistical methods to calculate risk levels<br/>
Compare our calculations against actual historical data to ensure accuracy<br/>
Create clear risk assessment scores for insurance professionals<br/>
Continuously refine our calculations as new data becomes available<br/>
<br/>
**Next Steps**<br/>
<br/>
Model Refinement:<br/>
<br/>
Continue fine-tuning hyperparameters<br/>
Implement cross-validation scoring metrics<br/>
Develop ensemble weighting strategies<br/>
<br/>
Risk Scoring System:<br/>
<br/>
Develop a standardized risk scoring system<br/>
Create risk categories for underwriting guidelines<br/>
Implement automated risk assessment tools<br/>
<br/>
Business Integration:<br/>
<br/>
Create API endpoints for real-time risk assessment<br/>
Develop user interfaces for underwriters<br/>
Establish monitoring systems for model performance<br/>
